    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to the tirimid website.
      I'm Tirimid (or tirimid) and I like making things.
      Generally: "things" means software, written works, conlangs, fun / wacky
      design ideas, and pretty much anything else creative.
      My favorite software license is the GNU GPLv3 and my favorite phoneme is
      /&#641;/.
      Also, I love teaching things - specifically programming, computer science,
      and math.
      I am by no means a professional graphical designer, so don't expect this
      website to be anything visually tolerable.
    </p>
